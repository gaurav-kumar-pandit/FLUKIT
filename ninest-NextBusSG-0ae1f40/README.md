## App philosophy

In short, I first made this app only for myself because I wasn't happy with any app that already exists. All I needed was a simple, clutter-free interface to show bus timings of only the buses I'm actually taking. On rare occasions, I wounldn't know where the bus stop is. I'd just use Google Maps. I never found large maps on bus apps useful.

### No map
The thing is, once you know where a bus stop is, you won't need to use the map again. If you already know where the stop is, the mpa on your scren takes more space. There are rare occasions when I don't know how to get to the bus stop, but that's why I have Google/Apple Maps.

### Clutter free interface
You need bus timings. I'm giving you bus timings. Period.

### Context-aware favorites
- You saved **Bus 14** at **Bedok Interchange** as a favorite.
- You open the app near **Bedok Interchange**
- We assume that you are taking **Bus 14**, so we put its timings at the top of the screen (refer to the images above)

<!-- <details>
<summary>What makes NextBus SG different from the other apps?</summary>
THe lack of required user interaction. If you've used most other bus timing apps in Singapore, you'll know that you often require a few taps to find the information you're looking for. In addition, the data you want is surrounded by other useless data. NextBus SG solves this problem through location-based favorites: when the app launches, you'll see bus timings for your favorites bus at your favorite stop only if you are nearby, thus reducing the amount of information you have to deal with.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why isn't there a map to view bus stops near by?</summary>
Simply put, a map takes up valuable screen space and battery. Maps also aren't used by everyone. A map with showing the location of the nearest bus stops is quite useless to someone who uses those bus stops every day. We understand that the lack of a map may make it difficult for users to find a bus stop if they've never seen it before, and we're looking into ways to ease this.

## Built setup

Your system requires the Flutter SDK. Follow the steps here to [install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) it on your system. Once Flutter is installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. In the `lib` folder, create `keys.dart` .

In `keys.dart` , paste the following:

```
final String apiKey = '<LTA API KEY>';
```

To get an API key, go to [LTA's Request For API Access web page](https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall/request-for-api.html) and fill out the form. The key is **required** for the app to work properly.

Once the key as been set up, the app can be tested with the following commands:

```
flutter run
```

Please check out the [**wiki**](https://github.com/themindstorm/NextBusSG/wiki) for additional information.

### Generating icons and splash screens

After updating `pubspec.yaml` , run these commands:

```
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
flutter pub pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

### Stuck at installing debug Android app?

Go to app settings and uninstall your app. The app may not appear in your launcher, but it could still be installed. Go to your settings, find it, and completely uninstall it.

This can also be done using ADB:

```
adb uninstall com.themindstorm.nextbussg
```

If this does not work, check out this [answer on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53394504/flutter-stuck-at-installing-build-app-outputs-apk-app-apk).

### Build Android APK and appbundle

```
flutter build appbundle
flutter build apk
```

Once the APK has been built, install it on a physcally connected Android device:

```
flutter install
```

If you have multiple devices, you can view a list of Android devices connected using this command:

```
adb devices
```

And to install the app on an Android device, copy the device ID and install the app using

```
flutter install <devce ID>
```
